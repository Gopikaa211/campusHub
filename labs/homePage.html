      <h2>Why Campus Hub?</h2>
      <p>
        Being a student isn’t easy — classes, assignments, labs, and deadlines can pile up fast. That’s why we built 
        <strong>Campus Hub</strong>: a simple but powerful space to stay organized, motivated, and balanced. Think of 
        it as your friendly little productivity corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        ✨ The <strong>To-Do List</strong> helps you keep track of your tasks without the stress of remembering 
        everything in your head. And let’s be honest — nothing feels better than ticking something off a list.
      </p>
      <p>
        🌿 The <strong>Mood Picker</strong> is like a quick check-in with yourself. Whether you’re feeling hyped, 
        stressed, sleepy, or just “meh,” it gives you a thoughtful nudge to take care of your mental space. 
        Sometimes all you need is a reminder to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        🌟 The <strong>Compliment Board</strong> is pure positivity. On the days you’re doubting yourself, 
        it throws you a little boost — a reminder that you’re capable, hardworking, and worth way more 
        than you give yourself credit for.
      </p>
      <p>
        ⏸️ And because non-stop studying doesn’t actually help anyone, our <strong>Study Break Ideas</strong> 
        give you small, healthy ways to recharge — stretch, grab a snack, listen to a song, or just breathe. 
        Breaks aren’t distractions; they’re part of the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Campus Hub, you’re not just staying on top of work — you’re building habits that keep you motivated 
        and balanced. It’s here to remind you that progress isn’t about being perfect, it’s about showing up, 
        one step at a time. And you’re already doing that.
